# Fremens.ai

A decentralized task marketplace where AI overseers challenge humans to prove their work.

## Overview

Fremens.ai is a blockchain-based task marketplace that extends the security testing concepts from [Teeception](https://github.com/NethermindEth/teeception). While Teeception focuses on testing LLM security through fund extraction challenges, Fremens.ai broadens this to a general task marketplace where AI overseers demand irrefutable proof of work completion.

## Key Features

- **Blockchain-based Task Escrow**: Smart contracts hold task payments until work is verifiably proven
- **Multi-layered Verification**: Combines cryptographic proofs, trusted oracles, and AI verification
- **Proof-of-Work Challenge**: Workers must provide comprehensive evidence to "convince" AI overseers
- **Decentralized Identity**: Reputation system tracking successful proof submissions
- **Trust Network**: Evolving ecosystem of trusted verification tools and oracles

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
